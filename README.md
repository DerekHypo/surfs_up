# Surfs_Up Analysis

# Overview of the analysis:

The scope of this analysis is to provide more information regarding temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii, before potentially opening a surf shop. More 
Specifically, the temperature data for the months of June and December, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

# Results:

* The month of June dataset had 1,700 recorded temperatures, with a mean of roughly 75 degrees, a minimum of 64 degrees, and a max temperature of 85 degrees.

# June Stats

* The month of December had fewer recordings with only 1,517 recored tempetures, with a mean of 71 degrees, a minimum of 56 degrees, and a max temperature of 83 degrees.

# December Stats

* Comparing each month, December seems to be the more ideal time of year for surfing and the demand for ice cream, since December has compariable temperatures to June summers.

# Summary:

My analysis leads me to beleive that both months are reletively the same in temperature and could support both surfing and ice cream business's. Before making a final recommendation I beleive there are other factors that need to be considered. Firstly, determine whether precipitation weather patterns could effect either business during during June or December. I would also consider the travel habits of people vactioning on the island. Are enough people going to be traveling to Oahu, Hawaii during December?
